# exchange-automation-tests

To run tests, run `npm run start`.

To view test report after tests are run, open `index.html` from `\exchange-automation-tests\cypress\report`.

To clear old reports (reports will be overwritten when starting tests again, though, this may be necessary in case some siles get renamed), run `npm run clear-reports`.
